# Application Security Program: A Practical Guide

If you're building or improving an application security (AppSec) program and feeling stuck, this repository is here to help. Drawing from my experience in developing, refining, and maturing AppSec programs, I've compiled a set of actionable resources to guide you through the process.

Within this repo, you’ll find everything you need to design and enhance your AppSec program, including:  
- **Documentation**: Key guidelines, policies, and templates.  
- **Processes**: Step-by-step workflows for integrating security into development.  
- **Diagrams**: Visual aids to help map out security processes and architecture.  
- **Best Practices**: Industry standards for building a solid AppSec foundation.  
- **Bug Bounty Program Guidance**: Insights on launching and managing a successful bug bounty program.  
- **Helpful Links**: Additional resources to expand your knowledge.

This repository serves not only as a practical resource but also as an **answer to the "why"**—a crucial element often missing from boot camps and crash courses. While those programs provide a lot of information quickly, they often skip the underlying purpose that drives AppSec success. Here, you'll get both the **how** and the **why**, empowering you to confidently implement security practices and advance your career. 

Use this as both a **playbook** and a **guide** for navigating the complexities of application security. Whether you're starting from scratch or enhancing an existing program, this resource is designed to propel you forward.
