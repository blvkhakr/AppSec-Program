## **📖 Purpose**  
This guide provides step-by-step instructions for developers to **onboard onto the Static Application Security Testing (SAST) platform**.  

> **Your Responsibilities:**  
> - Set up the SAST platform for your environment.  
> - Use the tool to **identify and remediate security vulnerabilities** in your code.  
> - Ensure you **do not introduce new security issues** in your commits.  
> - Follow **secure coding best practices**.  

---

## **📌 Step 1: Accept Your SAST Platform Invitation**  
✅ **Check Your Email**  
- You will receive an **invitation email** from the SAST platform.  
- Click the link in the email to **activate your account**.  

✅ **Log in Using SSO (If Required)**  
- Use **Single Sign-On (SSO)** with your company credentials.  
- If you have login issues, contact **[Security Team Contact]**.  

✅ **Verify Your Access**  
- Ensure you can access the correct organization and projects in the SAST platform.  
- If your access is incorrect, request a fix from **[Security Team Contact]**.  

---

## **🛠 Step 2: Install Developer Tools (Optional but Recommended)**  
✅ **Install the SAST CLI for Local Scanning**  
- The **Command Line Interface (CLI)** allows you to **scan your code locally before committing**.  
- Install the CLI using the following command (based on your OS):  
  ```bash
  brew install [SAST-CLI]  # macOS
  scoop install [SAST-CLI]  # Windows
  choco install [SAST-CLI]  # Windows
  npm install -g [SAST-CLI]  # Linux/macOS/Windows
  ```  

✅ **Authenticate the CLI**  
- Run the following command to authenticate:  
  ```bash
  [SAST-CLI] auth
  ```  

✅ **Install the SAST IDE Plugin (For Real-Time Scanning)**  
- **For VS Code:** Search for `[SAST Tool] Security Plugin` in the marketplace.  
- **For JetBrains (IntelliJ/PyCharm/WebStorm):** Install the plugin via JetBrains Marketplace.  
- **For Other IDEs:** Refer to the **[SAST Plugin Documentation]**.  

✅ **Verify the Installation**  
- Run a test scan in your local environment:  
  ```bash
  [SAST-CLI] test
  ```  
- If the scan runs successfully, your setup is complete!

## **🔄 Step 3: Understanding How SAST Works in Your Workflow**  
✅ **What Happens Automatically?**  
- The **Security Team** configures the SAST platform to scan your code.  
- SAST scans your **commits, repositories, or pipelines** depending on integration.  
- Findings are reported in the **SAST dashboard and security reports**.  

✅ **How to Use the SAST Tool as a Developer**  
- **During Development:** Run scans locally via the **CLI or IDE plugin**.  
- **Before Committing Code:** Ensure your changes do not introduce vulnerabilities.  
- **After Pushing Code:** Check the SAST dashboard for findings and fix them.  

✅ **Where to View Security Findings?**  
1️⃣ **SAST Web Dashboard** → See all project vulnerabilities.  
2️⃣ **IDE Plugin (If Installed)** → Get real-time feedback while coding.  
3️⃣ **Security Reports (If Enabled)** → Receive regular updates via email or Slack.  

---

## **⚠ Step 4: Handling Security Findings**  
✅ **How Are Findings Categorized?**  
| Severity Level | Action Required |
|---------------|----------------|
| 🟥 **Critical** | Must be fixed before merging. |
| 🟧 **High** | Fix as soon as possible. |
| 🟨 **Medium** | Best effort to resolve. |
| 🟦 **Low** | Fix when time permits. |

✅ **Fixing Issues**  
- Follow **SAST recommendations** for remediation steps.  
- Upgrade dependencies to the latest secure version.  
- Refactor code to address security weaknesses.  

✅ **Suppressing False Positives**  
- If a finding is incorrect, escalate it to **[Security Team Contact]**.  
- Provide justification for suppression requests.  

✅ **Handling Third-Party Dependencies**  
- If a required library is flagged as vulnerable, check for **patches or safer alternatives**.  
- If no fix is available, discuss with your team about mitigations.  

---

## **🔍 Step 5: Secure Coding Best Practices**  
✅ **Prevent Vulnerabilities Before They Happen**  
- Follow **[Secure Coding Guidelines]** for best practices.  
- **Validate all user input** to prevent SQL Injection & XSS.  
- **Use safe dependencies** by keeping them up to date.  
- **Avoid hardcoding secrets**—use a **secrets manager** or environment variables.  

✅ **Use SAST for Continuous Security**  
- Run `[SAST-CLI] test` before committing code.  
- Use **IDE plugins** for real-time vulnerability detection.  
- Stay informed on **security best practices**.  

---

## **📖 Step 6: Where to Get Help**  
✅ **Resources Available to You**  
- **SAST Web Dashboard:** View all findings and security reports.  
- **Security Team Contact:** Reach out for questions or issue escalation.  
- **Security Help Channel:** Join the support channel for discussions and updates.  
- **Official Documentation:** Refer to the **[SAST Tool Docs]** for troubleshooting.  

✅ **When to Reach Out for Help?**  
- If you **cannot log in** or access the platform.  
- If you **disagree with a security finding** and need a review.  
- If you need **guidance on fixing an issue**.  
- If you have **general security concerns** about your code.

## **🚀 Step 7: Next Steps & Final Checklist**  
✅ **Complete the following to finalize your onboarding:**  
☑ Accept the **SAST platform invitation** and log in via SSO.  
☑ Install the **CLI and IDE plugin** (if applicable).  
☑ Authenticate the SAST tool with `[SAST-CLI] auth`.  
☑ Run a **test scan** using `[SAST-CLI] test`.  
☑ Check the **SAST Web Dashboard** for security findings.  
☑ Review and resolve **Critical/High** vulnerabilities.  
☑ Join the **Security Help Channel** for ongoing support.  

🎯 **Once completed, you are officially onboarded!** 🎯
