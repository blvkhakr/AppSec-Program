## Getting Management Onboard for AppSec Success

To effectively implement an application security (AppSec) program, securing buy-in from management is essential. Without management’s support, the shift-left approach—embedding security early in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)—will struggle to succeed. The AppSec team must align with product teams, not the other way around. Here's a refined strategy for gaining alignment and ensuring smooth communication:  

1. **Secure Management Support First**  
   Ensure your director and manager are on board with communicating your plans to other leaders and teams, especially product teams and developers. Approaching developers without management’s backing can come off as overstepping boundaries and disrupt workflows. A top-down approach—where directives come from management—works best to maintain alignment and professionalism.

2. **Use Leadership Channels for Communication**  
   Even if your manager or director gives you autonomy, request that they deliver key messages to product teams first. This approach helps present a unified front, showing that the security team is aligned with leadership. Alignment is crucial; without it, the AppSec team may face resistance and struggle to move initiatives forward effectively.

3. **Validate Your Ideas with Leadership**  
   Use discussions with your director or manager as an opportunity to validate your ideas. If they agree with your plan and are willing to communicate it on your behalf, it’s a good indicator that your strategy is sound. If they hesitate or ask you to take the lead on communication, revisit your proposal to clarify any gaps. Ask questions to understand their perspective and adjust your approach if needed.

4. **Maintain Alignment Across Teams**  
   Keep in mind that your security director communicates with other parts of the business and upper management. This cross-team alignment ensures that everyone works together seamlessly toward shared goals. Collaboration at all levels fosters a unified effort, increasing the likelihood of success. 

5. **Communicate with Developers Once Management Is Onboard**  
   After securing management buy-in and confirming alignment with your leadership, you can engage with developers to introduce the security initiatives. With leadership's endorsement, developers will be more receptive to integrating security into their processes.  

Once management, product teams, and developers are in alignment with the initiatives, then you can move forward with working with the developers on different projects. Remember that all projects need to be communicated top-down and then executed by the appsec team in collaboration with other teams.
